# Assignment2-BinarySearchTrees

An Assignment on the binary search tree from the Data Structure course

# Ex1. Map it!

üç≠ `70 points`

## Overview

The `Map` class (often referred to as a "dictionary" or a "symbol table") is implemented as a binary search tree that stores in each node a **key** and a corresponding value. For example:

- A `Map<string, string>` object can map usernames (keys) to passwords (values), a word to its dictionary meaning, or a country to its capital city, etc.

- A `Map<string, int>` object can map student IDs (keys) to grades (values), words to the frequency of their occurrence in a book, cities to their population counts, etc.

The nodes in the BST are ordered by the key, not the value (keys can't repeat, but values can). For example, The following Map object maps cities to their population counts:

Note that `Amman > Ajloun` (because `m > j`) and `Amman < Aqaba` (because `m < q`).

You are given in this exercise a partial implementation of the class and are required to complete it.

## Things you are given

- Class `Node`: Each node has a `key`, a `value`, and pointers to the left and right child nodes.

- Class `Map`: This is similar to the `bst.h` implementation with the following main differences:

- There are two template parameters (`K` and `V`), not one.

- Function `void insert(const K& key, const V& val)` inserts the given key-value pair. If the key is already in the tree, its value is updated to be the newly received value.

- Function `V& value_of(const K& key)` returns a reference to the value corresponding to the given key. If the key is not in the tree, the function throws a string exception.

- The stream insertion operator (`<<`) is overloaded to allow for printing (in sorted order) the keys (and their values) .

- Many functions were removed.

## Functions You Need To Implement

Implement the following functions:
`(1)`Node<K, V>\* search(const K& key)` (16 points)

This function returns a pointer to the node containing the given key. If the key is not in the tree, the function returns `nullptr`.

The function must run in O(height) if the previous call to the function was for a different key. If the previous call was for the same key, the function must run in O(1). For example:

```cpp
search("A");  // O(height)
search("B");  // O(height)
search("B");  // O(1)
search("B");  // O(1)
search("A");  // O(height)
search("A");  // O(1)
search("B");  // O(height)
```

Note that if a key is searched for and then deleted from the map using one of the functions, then the next call to search should take O(height).

**(2)** `Map cut(const K& key)` (10 points)

This function removes the subtree rooted at `key` and returns a copy of it. It returns an empty Map object if `key` is not in the tree.

The function must run in O(height).

**Example.**

**(3)** `void trim(const K& lo, const K& hi)` (16 points)

This function removes from the tree all the keys larger than `hi` and all the keys less than `lo`.

The function must run in O(n).

**Example.**

**(4)** `bool has_duplicate_values() const` (12 points)

This function checks if there are any duplicate values (not keys) in the tree. The function must run in O(n√óheight).

**(5)** `V max_value() const` (16 points)

This function returns the maximum value (not key) that is in the tree. It throws a string exception if the map is empty. The function must run in O(n).

Notes:

- You are allowed to add new data members to class Map but not to class Node.
- You are allowed to add new private functions, but not new public functions.
- You are allowed to modify the implementation of the constructor.
- You are not allowed to modify the implementation of any of the given functions (except the constructor).

- All of your implementation must be provided in map.h.
